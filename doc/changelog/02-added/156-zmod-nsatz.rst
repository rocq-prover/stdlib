- in `ZmodNsatz` and `Zmod`

  + Added support for the `nsatz` tactic on `Zmod`
    (`#156 <https://github.com/coq/stdlib/pull/156>`_,
    by Andres Erbsen).

- in `Ncring_tac`

  + Added extension-point typeclass `extra_reify` that is only resolved on
    non-variables for which built-in syntax-directed reification did not find a
    match
    (`#156 <https://github.com/coq/stdlib/pull/156>`_,
    by Andres Erbsen).
